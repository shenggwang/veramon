A Turn-Based Role Playing Game (RPG).  
I had started this project in order to learn how to program with flutter.  

This project uses some free images and a free music downloaded from Internet.  
I can't really recall where I got them, but they aren't mine.

## Getting Started

I had done this project in 2019. Even though, the project is ready to run. Because I just run the project before uploading it.  
Although the background music stoped working every other part is working. 

### Quick start

Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

I'm using vs-code so I just installed the [plugin](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code)

### Read resources

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
